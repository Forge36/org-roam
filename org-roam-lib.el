It should be a list of symbols or cons cells representing any of
the following supported file search methods.

The commands will be tried in order until an executable for a
command is found. The Elisp implementation is used if no command
in the list is found.

  `find'

    Use find as the file search method.
    Example command:
      find /path/to/dir -type f \
        \( -name \"*.org\" -o -name \"*.org.gpg\" -name \"*.org.age\" \)

  `fd'

    Use fd as the file search method.
    Example command:
      fd /path/to/dir/ --type file -e \".org\" -e \".org.gpg\" -e \".org.age\"

  `fdfind'

    Same as `fd'. It's an alias that used in some OSes (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu)

  `rg'

    Use ripgrep as the file search method.
    Example command:
       rg /path/to/dir/ --files -g \"*.org\" -g \"*.org.gpg\" -g \"*.org.age\"

By default, `executable-find' will be used to look up the path to
the executable. If a custom path is required, it can be specified
together with the method symbol as a cons cell. For example:
\\='(find (rg . \"/path/to/rg\"))."
